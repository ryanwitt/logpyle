logpyle - logging for lazy programmers
======================================

Logpyles are full of snakes.

Goals:

 - Tame a large pile of loosely associated python programs
 - Automatically detect and log exceptions
 - Intelligently turn program output into log entries
 - Provide hooks
 - Make use of python's logging system whenever possible

## Interface

`
import logpyle
`

Do this in each python file you want to log.

## Configuring

Specify the directory where you want the logs to go.
